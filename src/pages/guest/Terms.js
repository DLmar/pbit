                    3.2 By accessing this User Agreement or using the Services, you agree and understand
                    that there are risks associated with utilizing Services involving Virtual Currencies
                    including, but not limited to, the risk of failure of hardware, software and

                    substantial and losses may occur over a short period of time. Price and
                    liquidity of crypto assets are subject to significant fluctuations, past
                    performance is not indicative of future results and you are solely
                    responsible for your actions.
                    <br/><br/>
                    3.5 You accept and acknowledge that PayBit is not responsible for your
                    investment losses.

                    requested as part of the account opening process to verify your identity and the
                    detection of anti-money laundering terrorist financing, fraud, or any other
                    financial crime and permit us to keep a record of such information.
                    <br/><br/>
                    4.3 You will need to complete certain verification procedures before you are
                    permitted to start using the PayBit Services.
                    <br/><br/>
                    4.4 The information we request may include certain personal information

                    network status, customer type, customer role, billing type, mobile device
                    identifiers (IMSI and IMEI) and other subscriber status details. In
                    providing us with this or any other information that may be required, you
                    confirm that the information is accurate and correct and you agree to keep
                    us updated if any of the information you provide changes. We will treat this
                    information in accordance with the Data Protection provisions of this
                    Agreement.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <strong>4.5 You authorize us to make enquiries, whether directly or
                        through third parties, that we consider necessary
                        to verify your identity or protect you and/or us against fraud or
                        other financial crime, and to take action
                        we reasonably deem necessary based on the results of such inquiries.
                        When we carry out these enquiries, you
                        acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be
                        disclosed to credit reference and fraud
                        prevention or financial crime agencies and that these agencies may
                        respond to our enquiries in full. This is
                        an identity check only and should have no adverse effect on your
                        credit rating. Additionally, we may require
                        you to wait some amount of time after completion of a transaction
                        before permitting you to use further
                        PayBit Services and/or before permitting you to engage in
                        transactions beyond certain volume limits.

                    <br/><br/>
                    4.6 Failure to provide any information that PayBit reasonably
                    requests from you pursuant to applicable money laundering laws and
                    regulations after you have become a Customer shall be grounds for
                    the suspension of the provision of Services to you (including access
                    to your account) and/or the termination of this Agreement. The
                    nature and extent of the information you are required to provide may
                    differ, for example, based on the Services provided to you under
                    this Agreement and/or the means of payment you use.
